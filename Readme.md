# Galvanize Q1 Project - Title/Escrow Rate Calculator
By * **Craig Fell** - A student at [Galvanize](https://galvanize.com)

This is a rate calculator for a title & escrow services company based in the south pacific.  All rates and fees are customized to the company, the region, and the underwriter.

## Motivation

My sisters company needed a rate calculator to host on their website, and I needed a project. :)


## User Stories / Use Cases
There are few use cases for this product, its function is fairly specific.

- A real estate agent would like a quote for services for a client.
- A potential client would like a quote for services for themselves.
- Any person living in the regions serviced by this would like to know the costs associated with purchasing a home.

### Prerequisites & Deployment

The application is built with browserify, and as such all scripts are linked with requires.  Deployment should be as simple as pushing all files to a hosted directory.
